MOD_SPORTSMANAGEMENT_UEFAWERTUNG_BERECHNUNG="<p><b>Calculation of the 5-year rating</b></p><p>A national association receives points for the successes of its club teams in UEFA competitions (wins, draws and reaching certain game rounds). The counters for all clubs are added up and divided by the number of participating clubs in the regional association. The result is rounded off after the third decimal place (no commercial rounding).</p><p>Only games that are played are counted. In addition, only the result after 90 or 120 minutes of play counts. A penalty shoot-out will not be considered when allocating counters.</p><p>Only clubs that have at least qualified for the Champions League, or the Europa League are counted.</p><p>These coefficients are added up over five seasons and result in the UEFA five-year ranking. Every year, the oldest ranking list falls out of the ranking and is replaced by the current one.</p><p><b>Awarding of points since 2009</b></p><p>Points are awarded for all matches in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League as well as the two associated qualifications, which are awarded as follows:</p><ul><li>Victory in the Champions League / Europa League: 2 points</li><li>Draw in the Champions League / Europa League: 1 point</li><li>Victory in the qualification of the Champions League / Europa League: 1 point</li><li>Champions League / Europa League qualifying draw: 1/2 point</li></ul><p>There are additional bonus points for reaching certain rounds:</p><ul><li>4 bonus points for participating in the Champions' League group stage.</li><li>5 bonus points for reaching the round of 16 of the Champions League.</li><li>1 bonus point each for reaching the quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals in both the Champions League and the Europa League.</li></ul><p><b>Notice:</b> UEFA publishes an updated ranking at the end of each match day. Bonus points are only considered when a game round (group stage, round of sixteen, etc.) has been completed. Deviating from this, our calculation takes place immediately after the end of a game; Bonus points are also awarded as soon as teams have reached the next game round relevant for the calculation!</p>"
